    <p> This is one of my current favorite healthy meals. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Drizzle of Oil</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Fresh (or dried) rosemary, minced</li>
        <li>Constarch slurry</li>
        <li>200g chiken stock</li>
        <li>Freshly Cracked Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 lemon slice, as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Thin out the chicken breast by slicing cross cuts into the thick end or pounding it flat with a pan. Add salt to both sides. (Optional) Brine for at least 1 hour or up to overnight. </li>
        <li>Set a pan over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of oil, enough to coat the entire pan in a thin layer.</li>
        <li>Once hot, add the chicken breast cut side down and sear. Sear for 1-2 minutes until the breast has developed deep browning on one side. Flip the chicken and repeat on the other side. Once browned on both sides, turn the heat down to medium-low. Cook until the internal temperature reads 155 F at the thickest point. Once cooked, set aside to rest while preparing the pan sauce.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat to medium. Add the minced garlic and cook, while stirring, for 30 seconds. Pour in the stock and turn the heat to high. While stirring reduce the liquid in half, for 2-4 minutes. If using storebought stock which will not have enough gelatin to thicken, add a splash of the cornstarch slurry to the pan and stir around until thickened to your liking.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off. Add the fresh cracked black pepper and lemon juice. Taste it! Add salt or other flavorings as needed.</li>
        <li>Slice the chicken on a bias and spoon the sauce over the top. Serve with salad, roasted vegetables or your side dish of choice.</li>
    </ol>
