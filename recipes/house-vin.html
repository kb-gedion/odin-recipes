    <p> This Balsamic Vinaigrette recipe is perfect. You heard me correctly. Perfect. And I don’t use that word lightly.</p>

    <p>The recipe I’m sharing with you today is truly worthy of that descriptor. You don’t think I’d call something the “best” if I didn’t mean it, do you?</p>
    
    <p>I’ve tried numerous recipes for balsamic vinaigrette over the past few years and while they have been decent, they were not quite what I was searching for.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
        <li>2 tbsp dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1 large galic clove minced</li>
        <li>1/4 cup balsamic vinegar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>1. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the honey, balsamic, mustard, salt, pepper and garlic.  </li>
        <li>2. Add the oil and whisk thoroughly to combine.</li>
        <li>3. Continue whisking until the dressing is fully emulsified.</li>
        <li>4. Store in a jar with a lid and refrigerate. Shake well before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
